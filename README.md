Step by step guide how to run a shopping website Two-Tier Application

To run shopping website application, we need two paramount things to make it efficient for development and deployment.
1.	Docker Volumes - Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. When a container is removed, its data stored in a volume remains intact, making volumes particularly useful for managing databases or other persistent data.
2.	Docker Networks - Docker networks allow containers to communicate with each other, providing isolation and security within Docker environments. They play a crucial role in enabling inter-container communication and ensuring that containers can discover and connect to each other easily.

Basic Commands of Volume - 
Create a volume: docker volume create <volume_name>
List volumes: docker volume ls
Inspect a volume: docker volume inspect <volume_name>
Remove a volume: docker volume rm <volume_name>
Use a volume in a container: docker run -d -v <volume_name>:/path/in/container <image_name>
Cleaning up: docker volume prune 
This command removes all unused volumes not currently referenced by any container.

Basic Commands of Networks – 
Create a Custom Bridge Network: docker network create my-bridge-network
Run a Container on a Custom Bridge Network: docker run -d --name my-container --network my-bridge-network my-image
List Networks: docker network ls
Inspect a Network: docker network inspect my-network
Connect a Running Container to a Network: docker network connect my-network my-container
Disconnect a Running Container from a Network: docker network disconnect my-network my-container
Remove a Network: docker network rm my-network
Cleaning Up Networks: docker network prune
This command removes all networks not currently in use by any containers, which can help keep your Docker environment clean and organized.

Commands Use for Shopping-website Two-tier Application – 
# Create a network
docker network create shopping-net
# Run MySQL container
docker run --name mysql-container --network shopping-net -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword -e MYSQL_DATABASE=shopping_cart -v mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql -d mysql:5.7
# Build and run Flask app container
docker build -t shopping-cart-app . (This dot denotes build the image in present directory) 
docker run --name flask-container --network shopping-net -p 5000:5000 -d shopping-cart-app
